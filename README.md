# ML-for-Material-Discovery-High-Entropy-Perovskite-Oxides
Machine-Learning Guided discovery of High Entropy Perovskite oxides via oxygen vacancy Engineering. In this project, we deployed an integrated framework that combines density functional theory (DFT) calculations, machine learning (ML) and experimental validations do predict oxygen vacancy formation energies in HEPO electrocatalysts.
